# To-Do List
Have you ever had the feeling that you're missing something important? If so, to-do lists can be of help. 
A clear outline of your daily tasks will help you stay composed and mentally focused. 
In this project, you will create a simple to-do list that can manage your tasks.

Work with checkboxes to mark tasks as complete and manage dynamic styles.
